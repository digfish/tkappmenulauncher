This project is a simple I made in order to implement a Portable Launcher for apps stored in a external drive. It's the first project in a series, that I made myself in order to have a feeling of which could be the best GUI framework for my needs.
This version was mode was to demonstrate the cappabilities of Tkinter through the easy development provided PySimpleGUI. 
More information about the project is my blog article [Selecting the best GUI programming toolkit â€“ part 2 (Tkinter in PySimpleGUI)](selecting-the-best-gui-programming-toolkit-part-2-tkinter-in-pysimplegui).

### Running

To run this project, you just have to run:
```
python launcher\main.py

```

This project is dependent in a fork I made for [PyStray](https://github.com/digfish/pystray) in order to add icons to the popup menu in the system tray. It is Windows only.
